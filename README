A bag of simple MELT examples, by Basile Starynkevitch 
(France, working at CEA, LIST)  <basile@starynkevitch.net>

MELT is a Domain Specific Language to extend the GCC compiler. See
http://gcc-melt.org/ for more about MELT, and http://gcc.gnu.org/ for
more about GCC.

The examples are either public domain, or free software licensed under
the LGPL license. (licensing may vary from file to file).  They are
developped on Gnu/Linux/Debian/Sid with a GCC 4.6 or better compiler.

Please discuss these examples and anything MELT related on the
low-traffic gcc-melt@googlegroups.com; we invite you to subscribe to
that list http://groups.google.com/group/gcc-melt if interested in
MELT (and in these examples).

Each example has a small file SUMMARY. Here they are:
####SUMMARIES:
==> ex01/SUMMARY <==
ex01/ - hello world in MELT                                      [Public Domain]
