A bag of simple MELT examples.

MELT is a Domain Specific Language to extend the GCC compiler. See
http://gcc-melt.org/ for more about MELT, and http://gcc.gnu.org/ for
more about GCC.

The examples are either public domain, or free software licensed under
the LGPL license. They are developped on Gnu/Linux with a GCC 4.6 or
better compiler.

Each example has a small file SUMMARY. So to get a feeling of the
examples, just run

   head ex*/SUMMARY
